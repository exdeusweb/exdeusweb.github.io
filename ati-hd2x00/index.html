<h2>ATI HD2x00 Registry Tweaks for Maximum HTPC Performance</h2>

<p>Supports Windows Vista x86/x64, XP &amp; MCE.</p>

 <p>This script is designed to add values to the Windows registry.
 Changing anything in the registry can be hazardous.
 No warranty is offered or implied. <b>Use at your own risk!</b></p>

 <p>This script will add a number of registry tweaks to enhance the
 performance of ATI HD2400 &amp; HD2600 series video cards for use in HTPCs.</p>

 <p>The simple way to use this program:<br>
 <br>
 Run the script (double-click). When you are prompted to approve a video device,
 read the "Device Description". If it looks like a description for your video card,
 go ahead and answer 'Yes' to agree that it is the correct device. When the program is done,
 run it again, and answer 'No' to the first device that looks like yours (the one you
 answered 'Yes' to last time) and keep looking for another device whose description
 matches your video card. This time answer 'Yes' for that device, and continue running
 the program as many times as it takes to add the registry tweaks for every video device
 that matches yours. There is no harm caused by adding the settings under multiple video
 devices, or even under video devices that aren't your active video card. The settings will
 be ignored by other devices.</p>

 <p>To make it more complicated:<br>
 <br>
 If you want to add a level of verification that you have the correct video device,
 open the ATI Catalyst Control Center, and select the
 Information Center &gt; Graphics Software section. The 2D Driver Path
 will show the GUID (the number between the curly brackets, "{}")
 for your active video device. When you run this program, you will be
 prompted for each video device on your system. When you see the
 GUID for your active video device, approve that device to add
 the registry settings.</p>

 <p>Note, however, that in Windows Vista the path in the CCC will not always match the
 one reported by this program, but the GUID should be the same.</p>

 <p>You will be prompted to approve the correct video device before
 anything in the registry is changed. To add settings for multiple
 devices, simply re-run the program and select a different device.
 For each device, the registry tweaks will be applied to both
 outputs 0000 and 0001.</p>

<p>This is a program written in VBScript. You can view the source code in your browser
or in any text editor. If you double-click it, it will run using the Windows Script Host,
included with every version of Windows. Your anti-virus software may bark when you download
or attempt to run this, because VBScript is fairly powerful and .vbs files have been used
to do some malicious things in the past. I have no malicious intentions, so I suggest you
let the program run, but if you're uncomfortable doing it, don't.</p>

 <h2>If your AGP card is not supported by the latest ATI drivers...</h2>

 <p>Sometimes the drivers don't get updated for every card for every driver release,
 so you need to edit a couple files to add your card. Run the installer, and continue
 until you extract the driver into a folder under C:\ATI\SUPPORT\. At the next opportunity,
 cancel the installation and navigate to the C:\ATI\SUPPORT\ folder in Windows Explorer.
 Edit the files as follows, and you can then run C:\ATI\SUPPORT\{Current Version}\Driver\setup.exe.</p>

 <p>The files you need to edit are: </p>

 <h3>Windows Vista</h3>
 <p style="font-weight:bold">C:\ATI\SUPPORT\{Current Version}\Driver\Packages\Drivers\Display\LH_INF\CX_*****.inf</p>

 <p>Under "[ATI.Mfg]", add the following lines. You can do a search for "HD 2400" to put the lines with the other
 entries for the HD2000 series.</p>

<p>"ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO AGP" = ati2mtag_RV610, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_94C4<br>
"ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO AGP" = ati2mtag_RV630, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_9587<br>
"ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT AGP" = ati2mtag_RV630, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_9586</p>

<h3>Windows XP/MCE</h3>
<p style="font-weight:bold">C:\ATI\SUPPORT\{Current Version}\Driver\Driver\XP_INF\CX_*****.inf</p>

<p>Under "[ATI.Mfg.NTx86]", add the following lines. You can do a search for "HD 2400" to put the lines with the other
 entries for the HD2000 series.</p>

<p>"ATI Radeon HD 2400 PRO AGP" = ati2mtag_RV610, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_94C4<br>
"ATI Radeon HD 2600 PRO AGP" = ati2mtag_RV630, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_9587<br>
"ATI Radeon HD 2600 XT AGP" = ati2mtag_RV630, PCI\VEN_1002&DEV_9586</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold">C:\ATI\SUPPORT\{Current Version}\Driver\Driver\CX_*****.INI<br>
C:\ATI\SUPPORT\{Current Version}\Driver\Driver\INSTALL.INI</p>

<p>In <bold>both files</bold>, under the "[WINXP]" section, add the following at the end of the second line,
which starts "R6=DriverPath_R6":</p>

<p>,0x9587,0x94C6,0x94C4,0x9586</p>
